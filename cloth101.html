    <h2> <a name="washing"> Washing</a> </h2>
  
  <img src="./images/cloth%20diapers%20line1.jpg" alt="cotton baby diapers line drying" class="wash">
<p>Washing BB Cloth Diapers is pretty simple, straight forward and extremely easy. After a few weeks you'll look back at how freaked out you were about washing cloth diapers and just wonder why? BB Cloth Diapers will need to be washed once prior to their first use. <strong>Important: As soon as you take the diaper off your baby or any other time before they go in the wash fold down the outer velcro tabs so they don't stick together.</strong> </p>
<h2>Newborn - 6 Months</h2>  
<p>At this stage we recommend a wet pail and a dry pail; the dry pail will most likely be beside the change table and the wet pail in the bathtub, bathroom, or laundry room. Pee diapers will go in the dry pail, poop diapers in the wet pail. </p> 

<h2>The Wet Pail: Newborn - 6 Months </h2> 
<p>We recommend filling the pail about 3/4's with water and adding some vinegar; the vinegar will neutralize the odor (which really isn't that bad). Before your baby is eating solids it is fine to just throw the soiled diapers directly into the wet pail without rinsing them first (of course you can give them a quick rinse and scrub in the sink if you want). On wash day drain the water into the tub or toilet (whatever is easiest) then dump the diapers along with any remaining water into the washing machine; there is no need to wring out each diaper before it goes in the wash. </p> 

<h2>The Dry Pail/Pee Diapers: 6 Months - Potty Training </h2> 
<p>The dry pail/pee diapers will be the same with the exception of the morning diaper (instructions below) and obviously there is no water in the pail. </p>

<h2>The Wet Pail: 6 Months - Potty Training </h2> 
<p>After your baby starts eating solid foods you can keep the wet pail, now you will simply shake the poop from the pad into the toilet before tossing it in the wet pail. The diaper can most times go into the dry pail because the poop will mostly land on the pad so only the pads are going into the wet pail. If the diaper is really messy and the poop doesn't shake off you can just put the whole pad in your toilet (clean toilet) to soak for a while and scrub it off a bit before throwing it in the wet pail. </p>

<h2>Washing </h2> 
<p>with 36 diapers you will be washing on average every 3 days, possibly every other day in the very beginning, then about every 4 days after 6 months.  If for some reason (starting potty training, baby has larger pees less often) you are going more than 4 days between washing it is a good idea to pre-soak your diapers in cold water before washing. Next (this is your first step if not going longer than 4 days) wash them in hot water with about half the recommended amount of detergent unless specifically baby friendly on the longest wash cycle with the highest water level.</p>  

<p>Instead of fabric softener use 1/4 - 1/2 cup of vinegar. Use the downy ball or fabric softener dispenser. </p>

<h2>Drying </h2>
<p>Throw the diapers in the dryer with a large white towel. This helps to cut down on the drying time. 

  <strong>Your Done!</strong></p>

<h2>Diaper Safe Detergents </h2>
<p>Tide, Purex, Sunlight, Norwex and many store brands and other natural detergents are good choices.  Ivory snow is not a good choice because it builds up on the diapers making them less absorbent. The decision is yours do whatever you are comfortable with and you think is best for your baby. The biggest thing with detergent is to make sure it is properly rinsed out to avoid build up.</p> 

<p>DO NOT USE BLEACH OR FABRIC SOFTENERS, BLEACH ATTACKS THE FIBERS OF YOUR COTTON DIAPERS SHORTENING THEIR LIFE AND REDUCING ABSORBENCY, FABRIC SOFTENERS BUILD UP ON THE DIAPERS CAUSING REDUCED ABSORBENCY. </p> 

<h2>Diaper Rash Creams </h2>
<p>Avoid using diaper rash creams containing zinc oxide, they are difficult to wash out. Instead try olive oil applied with a cotton ball or a natural diaper rash cream (there are some great options).  If the rash looks bad and or painful: F it use whatever cream works. It won't ruin the diapers and the cream will come out after a few washes. The most important thing is the comfort of your baby not your diapers. </p> 

<h2>What Pail Should I use </h2>
<p>We recommend using a garbage can with a removable liner, found a good one at Walmart for about $12, buy 2. Anything with a removable liner and or detached lid is good. You don't need to spend $45 on a pail specifically for cloth diapers. </p> 

<h2>What to do about diaper pail odor?</h2>  
<p>If you are noticing an odor from your diaper pail, wash it out while the diapers are in the wash. Put in some water and a nice smelling cleaner (or vinegar, lemon), wash/rinse it out and sprinkle some baking soda in the bottom afterward. You'll figure out what works best for you. 

<h2>When the morning diaper starts to stink</h2>  
<p>I would just quickly wash the overnight diaper out in the sink with whatever soap is there to get rid of the smell before putting it in the diaper pail. </p> 

<h2>When should I start to potty train? </h2> 
<p>Every baby is different but most can start around 16 months (or earlier) and be fully trained by 18-24 months. At this age their bladder is usually too small to go without an overnight diaper. It is best to wait until they can walk and tell you they need to "pee" or go "pot." Babies who wear BB Cloth Diapers understand the difference between wet and dry and will be much easier to get out of diapers than babies who wear disposables or super absorbent pocket diapers. Don't take the potty training too seriously, don't make it a stressful situation for you or your child; it will happen, just pay attention. It is a lot of work to potty train in the beginning but well worth the effort. A lot of people thought I was crazy when I started to work on potty training with my daughter around 12 months, but it was well worth it to not have to deal with diapers when she was only 18 months old. </p> 

<h2>Washing Your Covers </h2> 
<p>You will want to be easy on the covers and hand wash them to prevent cracking and tearing. By hand wash we simply mean quickly scrubbing them up in the bathroom sink using whatever soap is there (lukewarm water). After they have been washed shake them out and leave them propped up to dry quickly, near a heating vent works particularly well. In the summer line drying works very well. </p>
    <h1><a name="decide"> Making a Decision</a></h1> 
<p>I think the biggest reason more people don't end up using cloth diapers is because they never made a clear and firm decision about whether or not they were going to. After watching this 12 minute video I am confident that you will have the RIGHT answer for YOU and your family. Don't forget to <a href="take-the-test.html"> Take The Test HERE,</a> it will help you in figuring out if cloth diapers are right for you.</p>

    <h1>Choosing The Right Type of Diapers</h1>
  <p>After you have decided that YES cloth diapers are right for you, your next step is going to be figuring out the TYPE of cloth diapers that will best meet your needs. Some people want super absorbent diapers in beautiful prints and others want something that is trim fitting and very easy to wash and quick to dry; there are many things to consider when choosing a type of cloth diaper. The video will show you the different types and <a href="take-the-test.html"> the test</a> will help you decide if BB's are the right type of cloth diaper for you. </p>

    <h2> <a name="faqs"> Frequently Asked Questions </a></h2>
    
    <h3>Where does the poop go?!? </h3>
    <p>In the beginning it goes in the wetpail and after 6 months when the baby is eating solid foods it goes in the toilet. There are more details on this in the washing instructions but basically you just shake it out into the toilet and from there you either: put it in the wet pail, or quickly scrub it in the sink then into the dry pail. </p>
 
<h3>How many diapers do I need? </h3>
    <p>36. I think in terms of cloth diapers, more is better. More diapers translates to less washing/drying which means your diapers are going to last longer and you will spend less on your utilities. That being said, $400 upfront is a lot, especially during a time when you already have so much to buy; you could do it with 24, but more is easier. </p> 
 
<h3>Are Cloth Diapers Alot of Work?</h3>
    <p>Yes and No. They are more work in the beginning, but overall they are less work because your baby will be in diapers at least a year less than if they wore disposables. One thing that we hear again and again from our customers is how much easier it is than they thought it would be. Plus you never run out of diapers.</p> 
 
    <h3>Will cloth cause/increase the occurrence of diaper rash?</h3> 
    <p>No. The opposite is probably true. The main things in preventing diaper rash is: keeping them dry, clean, air circulation and maintaining the skins moisture. Before the introduction and eventual take over of disposables the occurrence of diaper rash was actually much lower. </p>
 
    <h3>What do I do when we are away from home? </h3>
    <p>Easiest solution here is to simply have a few plastic (or reusable wet bags) in your diaper bag and when you are out just put the wet or dirty diaper in the bag and deal with it when you get home. Sometimes on long road trips and planes disposables are a good idea. But for a trip to the mall, friends house etc. you will be fine to use your cloth diapers.</p>  
 
    <h3>Will things smell worse with cloth diapers </h3>
    <p>In terms of babies and diapers; sometimes things are going to smell pretty bad. It doesn't matter if you use disposables or cloth there are going to be times when the smell makes you want to vomit. With cloth it is a little more upkeep to keep your diaper pails from smelling, but at least you are not wrapping it up in plastic and sending it to a landfill where it will take hundreds of years to decompose.</p>

    <h2><a name="pottyTrain">Top Tips To Potty Train Early</a></h2>
    <h3>1. Start Early</h3>
    <p> People thought I was crazy when I started putting my daughter on the potty at 12 months/1 year but it worked! From 15 months on I never changed another poop diaper again. I've seen starting early work for lots of other parents too. There's this ridiculous myth that we shouldn't even start until they are 2.</p>
    <p> I know cloth is technically more work, at least in the beginning but I'd much rather put in a little extra effort to avoid changing a 2 or 3 year olds shitty diaper.</p>
    <h3>2. Give Positive Feedback</h3>
    <p> A rebellious toddler isn't so thrilled with some clapping and enthusiastic praise but in the 12-24 month range it works wonders.</p>
    <p> Make potty training seem like a super exciting and fun thing for your child to do!</p>
    <h3>Be Patient</h3>
    <p> You are going to need long term patience as well as short term. Short term is sitting at the potty with your child reading a book while they get the hang of things. </p><p>Long term is knowing that it's going to take a few months before your child just knows when they need to use the bathroom and does so on his or her own.</p>
    <h3>Be Consistent </h3>
    <p> Stick with it. Don't stop for a week because you had a few not so great days. Once you start potty training keep going. If you start and stop it's going to cause confusion for your child.</p>
    <h3>Expect Setbacks</h3>
    <p> Your kids going to piss on the floor, tell you after they went in their pants, tell you they have to use the potty to get out of another situation etc. Know going in that it's not just going to be smooth sailing the whole way. Knowing there are going to be setbacks will enable you to maintain a positive attitude and not get upset when they do happen.</p>
    <h3> Use Cloth Diapers</h3>
    <p> In the 50's the average age a child was potty tained was 18 months. Now, it's 37, more than double! WTF? </p>
    <p> In the 1950's all babies wore cotton cloth diapers, flanellete, which is what our diapers are made of. Do you think it's a coincidence that babies who felt moisture and were able to feel the sensation of peeing potty trained earlier.</p>
    <p> Disposable diapers have become more and more absorbent and efficient at wicking moisture. As this has happened potty training averages have consistently increased.</p>
    <p> Of course the diapers are not the only factor BUT they are a big part of it.</p>
    <p> Not all cloth diapers are equal when it comes to potty training. Pocket diapers use a fleece lining to wick moisture and a super absorbent pad to keep the baby feeling as dry as a disposable. A fantastic overnight option and when you're out running around but not the one you want your baby in the majority of the time.</p>
    <div class="pocketsSuck">
      <h2> <a name="pockets">BB's vs Pockets</a></h2>
      <p> At first sight and especially to someone with no cloth diapering experience pocket diapers would appear to be the gold standard. As usual looks can be a bit deceiving and there are a few things to consider when choosing the type of cloth diapers you will buy. Check out the video below for more on this, also the company used to be called Canada's Diaper Ladies which I shortened up a bit to BB when I got into building my own websites. Also, I no longer send out DVD's but if you REALLY want one just shoot me an e-mail; I still have a few kicking around.</p>

        <h2><a name="covers">Why A Two Part System is Actually BETTER</a></h2>
        <p> I know it's counterintuitive BUT a cotton diaper and separate cover is actually easier.</p>
        <h3>1. Easier Washing</h3>
        <p> When you're diapers and covers are separate you are able to wash them separately. Now this might sound like a pain in the ass but hear me out.</p>
        <p>With 100% cotton diapers with no attached cover to worry about damaging you can wash your diapers in hot water. You can dry them on high heat. AND you don't have to use a special detergent, you can use your regular detergent just a lesser amount. You can strip them in boilng water if they're stinky.</p>
        <p> When the diaper and cover are one in the same you have to treat the whole thing with a lot more care because the coatings that make the cover portion waterproof breakdown, wearoff and become not so waterproof which ruins the whole thing.</p>
        <p> If you're thinking washing covers separately is a big deal... IT'S NOT! BB's use the old school pull on covers which can quickly be rinsed off in the sink and left in the bathtub, hung up or propped over a heat register to dry. You can use whatever hand soap you have to quickly soap them up, rinse them then leave them to air dry which won't take more than an hour or two.</p>
        <p> Our kits come with 5 covers in every size so you have enough to rotate, wait and wash three at a time and use the others while they dry. It's very simple and easy.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Less Bulky</h3>
        <p> The old school pull on diaper covers are super lightweight, they flatten down to nothing and don't add any bulk. Our two part BB cloth diapers are the most trim fitting one size cloth diapers available.  </p>
        
        <h3> 3. More Durable Diapers</h3>
        <p> The diapers are more durable because they are not attacted to the cover/waterproof coating. We've had customers use the same $350 diaper kit on multiple babies!  </p>
        <h3>4. Easy To Put On and Take Off Moving Babies</h3>
        <p> The easiest things to get on a moving baby are the pull on diaper covers. I know snaps are all the rage right now but snapping the diapers on is a real pain. And for the actual diaper, velcro is way easier than snaps.  </p>
