    <h1> Why BB Cloth Diapers</h1>
    <h2> Trim Fit, Easy clean up, Easy to Size, Easy to wash, Affordable, Super durable, Canadian Made</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Most trim fitting one size diaper.</em> In the cloth diaper world, bulkiness is a huge and often overlooked issue. BB cloth diapers are trim fitting from birth to potty </li>
      <li>Much more affordable than most cloth diapers, a full birth to potty 36 diaper kit is only $350 Canadian!</li>
      <li> Made in Canada</li>
      <li>BB's are 100% cotton with a detached cover making them extremely easy to wash, very durable and trim fitting </li>
      <li>Super easy to size and really do give a great fit from birth to potty</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <h2> What Makes BB's Different From Most Other Cloth Diapers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>They are a two piece system requiring a diaper and waterproof cover. Many assume this will be more work  compared to an all in one cloth diaper when in reality it is not. Two separate pieces mean easier and more flexible washing instructions as well as shorter drying times.</li>
      <li>They have no elastic in the legs or waist. This helps to give that nice trim fit from birth to potty. </li>
      <li>They use velcro closures instead of snaps to provide a better fit and are much easier to get on a moving baby. </li>
     </ul>

    <h2> <a name="faqs"> Frequently Asked Questions </a></h2>
    
    <h3>Where does the poop go?!? </h3>
    <p>In the beginning it goes in the wetpail and after 6 months when the baby is eating solid foods it goes in the toilet. There are more details on this in the washing instructions but basically you just shake it out into the toilet and from there you either: put it in the wet pail, or quickly scrub it in the sink then into the dry pail. </p>
 
<h3>How many diapers do I need? </h3>
    <p>36. I think in terms of cloth diapers, more is better. More diapers translates to less washing/drying which means your diapers are going to last longer and you will spend less on your utilities. That being said, $400 upfront is a lot, especially during a time when you already have so much to buy; you could do it with 24, but more is easier. </p> 
 
<h3>Are Cloth Diapers Alot of Work?</h3>
    <p>Yes and No. They are more work in the beginning, but overall they are less work because your baby will be in diapers at least a year less than if they wore disposables. One thing that we hear again and again from our customers is how much easier it is than they thought it would be. Plus you never run out of diapers.</p> 
 
    <h3>Will cloth cause/increase the occurrence of diaper rash?</h3> 
    <p>No. The opposite is probably true. The main things in preventing diaper rash is: keeping them dry, clean, air circulation and maintaining the skins moisture. Before the introduction and eventual take over of disposables the occurrence of diaper rash was actually much lower. </p>
 
    <h3>What do I do when we are away from home? </h3>
    <p>Easiest solution here is to simply have a few plastic (or reusable wet bags) in your diaper bag and when you are out just put the wet or dirty diaper in the bag and deal with it when you get home. Sometimes on long road trips and planes disposables are a good idea. But for a trip to the mall, friends house etc. you will be fine to use your cloth diapers.</p>  
 
    <h3>Will things smell worse with cloth diapers </h3>
    <p>In terms of babies and diapers; sometimes things are going to smell pretty bad. It doesn't matter if you use disposables or cloth there are going to be times when the smell makes you want to vomit. With cloth it is a little more upkeep to keep your diaper pails from smelling, but at least you are not wrapping it up in plastic and sending it to a landfill where it will take hundreds of years to decompose.</p>

      <h2> <a name="pails"> Wet Pail vs Dry pail Vs Toilet </a> </h2>
      <p>Check out the video below for my advice on wet pails, dry pails and dunking dirty diapers in the toilet.</p>

      <h2> <a name="pockets">BB's vs Pockets</a></h2>
      <p> At first sight and especially to someone with no cloth diapering experience pocket diapers would appear to be the gold standard. As usual looks can be a bit deceiving and there are a few things to consider when choosing the type of cloth diapers you will buy. Check out the video below for more on this, also the company used to be called Canada's Diaper Ladies which I shortened up a bit to BB when I got into building my own websites. Also, I no longer send out DVD's but if you REALLY want one just shoot me an e-mail; I still have a few kicking around.</p>
